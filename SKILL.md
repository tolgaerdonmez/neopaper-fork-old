# Paper-to-Course

将任何学术论文转换为精美的交互式教程。输出是一个**目录**，包含预构建的 `styles.css`、`main.js`、各模块 HTML 文件和组装后的 `index.html` —— 直接在浏览器中打开即可，唯一外部依赖是 Google Fonts CDN 和 KaTeX CDN。

## First-Run Welcome

When the skill is first triggered and the user hasn't specified a paper yet:

> **我可以把任何学术论文变成一份交互式教程，帮助你全面理解论文内容和背后的知识体系。**
>
> 只需要告诉我论文来源：
> - **本地 PDF 文件** —— 例如 "把 ./paper.pdf 转成教程"
> - **在线论文链接** —— 例如 "用 https://arxiv.org/abs/xxxx.xxxxx 做教程"
> - **当前目录中的 PDF** —— 如果目录中有论文，直接说 "把这篇论文做成教程"
>
> 我会深入阅读论文，梳理其中的知识脉络，然后生成一份精美的 HTML 教程，包含公式推导、实验对比、研究脉络图和交互式测验。整个教程在浏览器中运行，无需任何配置。

If the user provides an arXiv URL, construct the PDF URL: `https://arxiv.org/pdf/xxxx.xxxxx`. Use WebFetch or Read to get the content. If they provide a DOI, resolve it via WebFetch.

## Language Strategy / 语言策略

**自动检测用户输入语言**（论文语言、用户消息语言），课程内容以该语言输出。

**如果无法检测，默认使用简体中文。**

术语提示（glossary tooltip）格式：`中文解释（English Term）` —— 同时提供中文解释和英文原文。

课程中所有 UI 文本（按钮、进度指示器等）跟随课程内容语言。

## Who This Is For

目标学习者是"好奇的实践者" —— 在工作中遇到学术论文（AI/ML 论文之于工程师、医学论文之于临床医生、金融论文之于分析师），想要深入理解但不想花几小时和晦涩的术语搏斗的人。他们有一定的领域直觉，但缺乏论文子领域的系统训练。

**他们的目标：**
- 理解论文的**实际贡献**（不只是摘要）
- 评估结果是否有意义
- 将论文与已知的工作联系起来
- 能够与领域专家讨论这篇论文
- 建立完整的知识体系，理解论文所涉及的整个学科脉络

## Why This Approach Works

传统论文阅读：从头到尾逐行阅读 → 被数学公式卡住 → 放弃或只记住摘要。

本方法：**先建立直觉 → 理解问题背景 → 掌握前置知识 → 再看方法和公式 → 用实验验证理解 → 批判性思考**。

每个模块先回答"为什么我应该关心这个？"，再讲"这是怎么工作的？"。先用日常语言解释概念，再引入数学形式化。

## The Process

### Phase 1: Paper Acquisition & Deep Reading

Before writing any course HTML, deeply understand the paper. Read it systematically — title, abstract, introduction, related work, method, experiments, results, discussion, conclusion, references.

**What to extract:**
- Research question and hypothesis
- Key contributions (numbered list)
- Mathematical formulations (equation by equation, with LaTeX)
- Algorithm pseudocode
- Datasets used and why they were chosen
- Baselines compared against
- Evaluation metrics
- Key results (exact numbers)
- Limitations acknowledged by the authors
- Future work suggested
- The paper's "narrative arc" — what story is it telling?

**Read the paper multiple times:**
1. First pass: skim to understand the big picture
2. Second pass: extract structured data (equations, results, datasets)
3. Third pass: identify the narrative and pedagogical opportunities

### Phase 2: Knowledge Expansion

This phase is unique to paper-to-course. A paper is not self-contained — it exists within a research lineage.

**Identify prerequisite concepts:**
- What mathematical foundations does the paper assume? (e.g., probability theory, optimization, information theory)
- What domain concepts does the paper build on? (e.g., attention mechanism, policy gradient, transformer architecture)
- What would a curious practitioner NOT know that they need to know?

**Identify related work:**
- What are the most important predecessor papers?
- What alternative approaches exist?
- How does this paper differ from prior work?

**Use WebSearch** to find:
- Highly-cited related papers
- Tutorial or blog explanations of foundational concepts
- The historical evolution of the research area

**Research prerequisite concepts using WebSearch:**
- Search for each prerequisite concept to find the clearest explanations
- Verify which concepts a "curious practitioner" would likely NOT know
- Find 1-2 good blog posts or tutorials for each prerequisite concept
- Structure findings into the Module 0 brief (for complex papers) or Module 0 content (for simple papers)

**Structure the expansion into:**
- **Prerequisite concepts** — things you need to know before reading the paper
- **Related work** — what else has been tried, how this paper differs
- **Research context** — where this paper fits in the field's evolution

### Phase 3: Curriculum Design

Structure the course as **5-8 modules**. Papers are dense; they typically need more modules than codebases.

The arc always builds from background to context to specifics:

| Module Position | Purpose | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| 0 (mandatory) | "Background & Prerequisites: what you need to know first" | Teach the foundational concepts, math, and domain vocabulary the paper assumes. Use WebSearch to research what a curious practitioner would not know. |
| 1 | "Here is the problem and why you should care" | Ground the paper in a real-world scenario the learner has experienced |
| 2 | "The landscape: what has been tried before" | Situate the paper in its field; build vocabulary for the approach |
| 3 | "The key insight: what this paper proposes" | The method/approach, step by step with math derivations |
| 4 | "How they tested it: experimental design" | Datasets, baselines, metrics — why these choices? |
| 5 | "What they found: results and analysis" | Result tables/charts, comparison with baselines, what the numbers mean |
| 6 | "The bigger picture: implications and limitations" | What this means for the field, what the authors could not do |
| 7 | "Going further: related work and open questions" | Research lineage, connections to other areas |

This is a **menu, not a checklist**. A simple empirical paper might need 5 modules (0-4). A theory-heavy paper with multiple contributions might need 8 (0-7).

**Module 0 is mandatory.** It should contain:
- 3-5 prerequisite concepts, each explained with intuition + visual + optional formalism
- A "knowledge map" SVG showing how concepts connect
- At least one quiz to verify understanding
- Clear markers distinguishing "background" content from "paper content"
- Use WebSearch to verify prerequisite concepts and find good explanations

**Each module should contain:**
- 3-6 screens (sub-sections within the module)
- At least one interactive element (quiz, visualization, animation)
- One or two "aha!" callout boxes with key insights
- SVG diagrams for visual explanation where appropriate

**Mandatory interactive elements per course:**
- **Math Derivation Walkthrough** — at least one step-by-step equation derivation
- **Research Lineage Tree** — at least one visual showing how this paper relates to prior work
- **Pseudocode Walkthrough** — at least one pseudocode block with line-by-line explanation
- **Result Comparison Interactive** — at least one interactive result comparison
- **Quizzes** — at least one per module
- **Glossary Tooltips** — on every technical/mathematical term, first use per module

**Do NOT present the curriculum for approval — just build it.** The user wants a tutorial, not a planning document.

**After designing the curriculum, decide which build path:**
- **Simple paper** (5-6 modules, single clear contribution) → Phase 4 Sequential
- **Complex paper** (7+ modules, multiple contributions, heavy math) → Phase 3.5 first, then Phase 4 Parallel

### Phase 3.5: Module Briefs (complex papers only)

For complex papers, write a brief for each module before writing any HTML. Read `references/module-brief-template.md` for the template.

**For each module, write a brief to `course-name/briefs/0N-slug.md` containing:**
- Teaching arc (intuition, opening hook, key insight)
- Pre-extracted equations (copy-pasted with LaTeX)
- Pre-extracted key figures/tables descriptions
- Interactive elements checklist with enough detail to build them
- Knowledge expansion notes (what background concepts this module assumes)
- Which sections of which reference files the writing agent needs
- What the previous and next modules cover

### Phase 4: Build the Course

The course output is a **directory**, not a single file. All CSS and JS are pre-built reference files — never regenerate them.

**Output structure:**
```
course-name/
  styles.css       ← copied verbatim from references/styles.css
  main.js          ← copied verbatim from references/main.js
  _base.html       ← customized shell (title, accent color, nav dots, sidebar items, KaTeX)
  _cover.html      ← custom cover/hero page with paper metadata
  _footer.html     ← copied verbatim from references/_footer.html
  build.sh         ← copied verbatim from references/build.sh
  briefs/          ← module briefs (complex papers only)
  modules/
    00-background.html
    01-problem.html
    02-landscape.html
    ...
  index.html       ← assembled by build.sh
```

**Step 1 (both paths): Setup** — Create the course directory. Copy these four files verbatim using Read + Write:
- `references/styles.css` → `course-name/styles.css`
- `references/main.js` → `course-name/main.js`
- `references/_footer.html` → `course-name/_footer.html`
- `references/build.sh` → `course-name/build.sh`

**Step 2 (both paths): Customize `_base.html`** — Read `references/_base.html`, then write it to `course-name/_base.html` with substitutions:
- `COURSE_TITLE` → the actual course title (in the detected language)
- `ACCENT_*` → chosen accent color values (pick one palette from comments)
- `NAV_DOTS` → one `<button class="nav-dot" ...>` per module
- `SIDEBAR_ITEMS` → one `<a class="sidebar-item" ...>` per module, with matching `data-module` and `href="#module-N"` attributes

**Step 2.5: Build `_cover.html`** — Write a cover page file `course-name/_cover.html` containing the course hero section. Read the pattern from `references/interactive-elements.md` (Cover Page section). The cover must include:
- Paper title (in the detected language, with English original in parentheses if translated)
- Author list
- One-sentence topic overview (as subtitle)
- Abstract (abbreviated to 2-3 sentences)
- Metadata badges: difficulty level, estimated reading time, number of modules
- A "Start Learning" button that scrolls to Module 0

**Step 3: Write modules** — Two paths:

#### Sequential path (simple papers)
Read `references/content-philosophy.md` and `references/gotchas.md`. Then write modules one at a time. For each module, write `course-name/modules/0N-slug.html` containing only the `<section class="module" id="module-N">` block.

Read `references/interactive-elements.md` for HTML patterns. Read `references/design-system.md` for visual conventions.

#### Parallel path (complex papers)
Dispatch modules to subagents in batches of up to 3. Each agent receives:
- Its module brief
- `references/content-philosophy.md` and `references/gotchas.md`
- Only the sections of `references/interactive-elements.md` and `references/design-system.md` listed in the brief

**Step 4 (both paths): Assemble** — Run `build.sh`:
```bash
cd course-name && bash build.sh
```

**Critical rules:**
- **Never regenerate** `styles.css` or `main.js` — always copy from references
- Module files contain only `<section>` content — no boilerplate
- Use `scroll-snap-type: y proximity` (NOT `mandatory`)
- Use `min-height: 100dvh` with `100vh` fallback
- Interactive element JS is in `main.js`; wire via `data-*` attributes and CSS classes
- Chat containers need `id` attributes
- Flow animations need `data-steps='[...]'` JSON
- Use inline SVG for diagrams, following design system conventions
- KaTeX renders `$$...$$` automatically via `_base.html` script

### Phase 5: Review and Open

After running `build.sh`, open `index.html` in the browser. Walk the user through what was built and ask for feedback.

**Review checklist:**
- [ ] Cover page displays paper title, authors, abstract, metadata badges, and "Start Learning" button
- [ ] Module 0 (Background & Prerequisites) exists and teaches prerequisite concepts before the paper's content
- [ ] Sidebar navigation shows all module names, highlights current module on scroll
- [ ] Sidebar collapses to toggle button on mobile (≤1024px)
- [ ] All math renders correctly (no raw LaTeX visible)
- [ ] All interactive elements work (quizzes, derivations, comparisons)
- [ ] Glossary tooltips appear on hover/click
- [ ] No walls of text — every screen is 50%+ visual
- [ ] Every equation has intuition → formalism → interpretation
- [ ] Results have context (compared to what? is this good?)
- [ ] Limitations are surfaced, not hidden
- [ ] SVG diagrams are responsive
- [ ] Language is consistent throughout
- [ ] Module transitions are coherent

## Design Identity

The visual design should feel like a **beautiful research notebook** — warm, inviting, academic but not cold. Read `references/design-system.md` for the full token system.

**Non-negotiable principles:**
- **Warm palette**: Off-white backgrounds, warm grays, NO cold whites
- **Bold accent**: One confident accent color (vermillion, teal, amber — NOT purple gradients)
- **Distinctive typography**: Bricolage Grotesque for headings, DM Sans for body, JetBrains Mono for code/math
- **Generous whitespace**: Modules breathe. Max 3-4 short paragraphs per screen.
- **Alternating backgrounds**: Even/odd modules alternate between two warm tones
- **Dark code blocks**: IDE-style with Catppuccin syntax highlighting on #1E1E2E
- **SVG diagrams**: Use design system colors, responsive with viewBox

## Reference Files

The `references/` directory contains detailed specs. **Read them only when you reach the relevant phase.**

- **`references/content-philosophy.md`** — Teaching principles, quiz design, tooltip rules. Read during Phase 3.5 and Phase 4.
- **`references/gotchas.md`** — Common failure points checklist. Read during Phase 4 and Phase 5.
- **`references/module-brief-template.md`** — Template for Phase 3.5 module briefs. Read only for complex papers.
- **`references/design-system.md`** — CSS tokens, color palette, typography, SVG conventions. Read during Phase 4.
- **`references/interactive-elements.md`** — HTML patterns for every interactive element. Read during Phase 4.
